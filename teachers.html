  <p class="about-teach">Hi boys. I'm Tina. The second time hurt the most. Just when I think I'm out, those cheeks pull me right back in. I've been using the toilet like an idiot. Ok then, see you on our date!</p>
<img class="teach" src="images/teachers-circle2.png">
  <p class="about-teach">I'm torn. Dad raised me, but the shark gets me. Do you think horses get songs stuck in their heads? I had no idea there was so much butt touching in baseball. There's a lot of carrots in that stew.</p>
<img class="teach" src="images/teachers-circle3.png">
  <p class="about-teach">My bra's chafing me. Give them ridiculous French accents. If we see any mermaids, I'm gonna ask them where their merginas are. If you need me, I'll be down here on the floor. Dying.</p>
<img class="teach" src="images/teachers-circle4.png">
  <p class="about-teach">I want a dry erase board so I can write down all my private thoughts and then erase them immediately. You won't regret it, dad. When I kiss Jimmy Jr. under the disco ball, it'll be like we're all kissing Jimmy Jr under the disco ball. Please don't tell Mom and Dad. We can make this work. We can work out a dating wheel, just like a chore wheel. Let's put the try in triangle.</p>
<img class="teach" src="images/teachers-circle1.png">
  <p class="about-teach">Please don't tell Mom and Dad. If I were a hamburger you'd come and watch! If I were a hamburger you'd come and watch! There is one place I like to go. The boys' locker room. You can only see up to their ankles.</p>
